Application Name: CU Lost and Found

Application Description: 
	As of now, the University of Colorado at Boulder’s lost and found system is a strange mess of boxes in each building, each with different policies and overseers. Any items of value are supposed to be turned in to the CU police department and while some buildings have a policy of turning in items to CUPD, not all do. The necessary solution is to create a universal system that connects every building on every Boulder campus to a unified lost and found network.
	The CU Lost and Found application is a modern solution to lost and found, reconnecting students with their misplaced property in a more dynamic approach. With a quasi social network of lost items, the application serves as a straightforward and accessible tool.  By compiling all information on lost items into one place, this application eliminates the need for students to run around campus trying to relocate their belongings.  
With this app, students can post when an item is either lost or found.  Postings include a location tag, a brief description, and any additional information that may be useful.  All posts are then sorted by location to narrow down the search.  This application requires a valid school email in order to verify that all people using the application are affiliated with the school. 

Vision Statement: CU Lost and Found is an online resource for CU students to catalog missing/found items campus wide. Unlike current systems in place, that requires either going to the CU police department or knowing a building specific procedure, CU Lost and Found will be a way for CU students to directly contact the party of the missing/found item.
